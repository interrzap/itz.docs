## Overview

**InterrZap** is a platform that businesses or teams can use to bridge all the services/apps they use to empower their workflow into one single platform and work with them connected seamlessly, efficiently and 2x the speed!&#x20;

InterrZap stands out because it not only serves as a comprehensive platform for briding all apps and services for teams, but it also enhances the overall workspace by avoiding a dull and complex user interface. We call it as "**Environments**." These are powered by the WEBGUI, a collection of intuitive, productive, and powerful web operating systems (WebOS) that create an interface resembling that of a traditional desktop environment, allowing all integrated apps to function in draggable windows.

We offer three variants of the WEBGUI: Ripen OS, Elixr OS, and Flux OS. Each variant is tailored to meet specific needs and can be selected at any time...Imagine it as a shelf where you can organize all apps in it and mobilize them, i.e. accessible anywhere, and on any device.
